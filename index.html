                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
                Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                far beyond the world of known physics.
                <br /><br />
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
                discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
                force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
                for a prodigiously violent instant.
                <br /><br />
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
                heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
                mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
                beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                <br /><br />
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
                and drew a double box around it.
                <br /><br />
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
                that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
                hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                <br /><br />
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
                time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
                John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
                waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
                when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
                correct.
                <br /><br />
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
                many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                <br /><br />
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
                comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
                apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
                and space and energy to science and speculation.
                <br /><br />
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
                billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
                galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
                universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
                into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                <br /><br />
                <span class="emphasis">‘As Big as It Gets’</span>
                <br /><br />
      
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
                accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
                Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
                waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
                should ruffle space-time.
                <br /><br />
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it
                gets.”
                <br /><br />
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                <br /><br />
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
                of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
                the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
                of the sun.
                <br /><br />
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
                Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
                reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
                Astrophysical Journal.
